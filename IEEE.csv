In todays age of bigdata, RSs have become important tools for finding relevant items from numerous options. RSs for web-based learning assist learners in discovering relevant learning content, according to requirements. Since learners have diverse needs and contexts, recommendations need to be highly personalized. In web-based learning, MOOCs are globally accessible online courses, designed to support learning of a large number of students of different backgrounds. For modelling users, existing MOOC RSs focus on extrinsic properties such as demographics, ratings, whereas a students learning is more dependent on intrinsic qualities like competency, learning styles. In this work, a new RS prototype has been designed, for recommending MOOCs based on requirements and learning styles. This prototype is based on an adapted version of the FSLSM LS model and works exclusively for edX MOOCs.","","978-1-5386-0569-1978-1-5386-0568-4978-1-5386-0570","10.1109/SmartTechCon.2017.8358407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8358407","Recommender systems;Learning Styles;MOOCs","Prototypes;Adaptation models;Tools;Computational modeling;Metadata;Recommender systems;Learning systems","computer aided instruction;educational courses;information filtering;Internet;recommender systems","users modelling;Web-based learning;relevant learning content;information filtering systems;Recommender Systems;edX courses;recommender system prototype;edX MOOCs;recommending MOOCs;learning styles;students learning;MOOC RSs focus","","1","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Problems exist in current learning recommender system available to student in that they are often of a general learning content not offering a personalized service. To overcome this, An adaptive learning path recommendation system (ALPRS) is proposed comprising: (a) Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) is applied to acquire the key factors in learning content; (b) Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Model (ISM) is further utilized for establishing the adaptive learning path hierarchical structure; and (c) repertory grid technology (RGT) is further used for acquiring the effects of the recommender element attributes of the adaptive learning path. The result show that the learning outcome with ALPRS is better than it with general learning course guided recommendation mechanism, and the scores of system satisfaction with ALPRS and personal service are higher than 90; recall (95%), precision (68%), F1 index (45%), and MAE (8%) in ALPRS outperform other approaches. Finally, three contributions are organized in this study. (1) The novel hybrid ALPRS is proposed and tested the practicability. (2) A prototype gamification geometry teaching material module is developed for the promotion in MSTE (Mathematics, Science, and Technology Education) areas. (3) The adaptive geometry learning path diagram generated with ISM based on learning styles could offer reference for successive studies.","","978-1-4673-9888-6978-1-4673-9889","10.1109/ICASI.2016.7539768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7539768","Mathematics education;Intelligent Learning Recommender System;Gamifying;Learning Style;Kelly Repertory Grid","Decision support systems;Frequency division multiplexing;Animation;Games","computer aided instruction;computer games;fuzzy set theory;geometry;recommender systems","intelligent gamifying learning recommender system;learning styles;Kelly repertory grid technology;adaptive recommendation;e-learning systems;learning content;personalized service;adaptive learning path recommendation system;ALPRS;fuzzy Delphi method;FDM;fuzzy interpretive structural model;ISM;adaptive learning path hierarchical structure;RGT;recommender element attributes;general learning course guided recommendation mechanism;personal service;gamification geometry;teaching material module;MSTE;adaptive geometry learning path diagram","","1","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Along with the development of technology, blended learning becomes very popular in education. A good blended learning is a blended learning that fits the current educational challenges of combining learning activities, supported by tools and technologies such as web 2.0 tools and recommender systems. In previous research, has been built a recommender system that recommends e-tivity, possible collaborators, web 2.0 tools, and bits of advice. The recommender system was built with collaborative filtering and content-based techniques. Collaborative filtering and content-based have problems in terms of dependency with data history, so it is possible to ramp-up and gray sheep on the recommendation. One way to overcome the problem of ramp-up and gray sheep is with knowledge-based. This paper proposes a knowledge-based recommender system to improve learning model in schools. Recommendations are based on VAK learning styles and collaborative learning theory. This research uses Design Research Methodology. The results showed that the experimental class score was higher than the control class. Using inferential statistics, it can be concluded that proposed knowledge-based recommender system significantly enhance learning in school.","","978-1-5386-3100-3978-1-5386-3098-3978-1-5386-3101","10.1109/ICITSI.2017.8267937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8267937","Knowledge-Based Recommender System;VAK Learning Style;Collaborative Learning;Web 2.0","Hafnium","computer aided instruction;educational courses;Internet;recommender systems","knowledge based recommender system;junior high school;student-centered activities;learning activities;VAK learning styles;collaborative learning theory;blended learning;Web 2.0 tools;learning model enhancement;design research methodology;experimental class score;inferential statistics","","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The work is then extended to examine how student interaction and student learning styles affect the learning outcomes. Different responses to the media combinations are observed and significant differences occur between learners classified as Sensing and Reflective learners. The experiment also identified some important differences in performance with the different media combinations by students registered as Dyslexic. The experiment was therefore repeated with a much larger sample of Dyslexic learners and the earlier effects were found to be significant.

Since the general student body consists of many different types of learning styles, these new tools can provide a means to reach a wider range of students than the traditional blackboard-based lectures. However, as a first step towards assessing the effectiveness of the tablet PC as a teaching tool, it is important to determine if it is well received by students of all learning styles. It is the purpose of this paper to report on the impact of the tablet PC on the students in four different courses, which were given over a period of three semesters. This impact was measured through a survey which was completed by the students at the end of each term. Overall, the students in all courses (a total sample size of 280) were quite positive about the use of the tablet, with 56% of the students stating that ¿The technology of the tablet...greatly improves my learning experience.¿ It was found that there were no statistically significant differences in how the students of different learning styles responded to the use of the tablet PC. In fact, all learning style groups reacted quite positively to its introduction into the classroom. However, some results indicate that a large group of students have a preference towards a more active classroom.

IPCC 2003. Proceedings.","","2003","","","5 pp.","","Cross-cultural differences have a major influence on the way instruction is shaped and the way learning takes place within any classroom. In a blended learning environment, non-English-speaking trainees often need to adapt to the concept of computer-aided instruction or learning online while they learn how to cope with a new and different teaching style. For example, in a typical classroom, where interactivity is a goal, an Asian learner may have a difficult time overcoming his or her traditional role as respectful listener. An Asian learner who has never worked with computer-aided instruction may find it difficult to cope with learning the system while having to master the content delivered through the system. This paper examines learning styles preferred by Asian learners and how these preferred styles affect the delivery of a blended learning Aviation English program to be delivered in China.","","0-7803-7949","10.1109/IPCC.2003.1245513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1245513","","Electronic learning;Computer aided instruction;Cultural differences;Human factors;Education;Displays;Concrete;Technological innovation;Shape;Building materials","distance learning;prejudicial factors","blended learning pedagogy;East Asian learning style;cross-cultural differences;nonEnglish-speaking trainee;computer aided instruction;online learning;teaching style;Asian learner;aviation English program;e-learning","","2","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

L3OP (Learning Objects Technology in Object-Oriented Programming ELearning System) project applies the Learning Objects concept into electronic learning system focusing on digitalizing learning styles (especially among higher education students). The electronic learning systems have been used by these students since past few generations and many of them have been enhanced. However, some students still feel that the electronic learning systems are not as effective as they may seem. The reason is varieties of traditional methods of learning styles used by these students, for example, jotting down and highlighting notes cannot be done in the electronic learning systems. For example, some students prefer to use highlight pen or marker to underline the important notes. However, the electronic learning systems can not digitize the styles. The project is only concentrated on visual type of learners. The Learning Objects approach used in this project not only to ensure the organization of the database but also the reusability of the learning content itself.","","0-7695-2687","10.1109/CIT.2006.111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4020016","","Electronic learning;Object oriented programming;Information technology;Stress;Application software;Software engineering;Computer science;Programming profession;Standards organizations;Educational technology","","","","4","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One such - Learning styles, is often considered as necessary for ensuring productivity and learner satisfaction in a learning environment. This paper investigates learning styles used in a flipped classroom environment implemented with the aid of a popular social network. In the preliminary analysis, the learning styles of the learners are gathered through a computer-based test, and a simple feedback survey was carried out to evaluate whether the content presentation and flipped approach was satisfactory. The results in this case suggest that the satisfaction of students in a flipped classroom benefit from content prepared to match the selected learning styles of users (Visual).","","978-1-5386-7447-5978-1-5386-7448","10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2018.00199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8693394","Flipped Classrooms, Learning Styles, Blended Learning, ICT in Education","","computer aided instruction;social networking (online)","Flipped Classroom concept;traditional classroom lecture;productivity;learner satisfaction;learning environment;flipped classroom environment;learning styles;social networks;learning management systems;content presentation","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although professors can be quite good at teaching students how to choose the appropriate equation and calculate an answer, often these students do not come away from the course with a deep conceptual appreciation of the material. The current study investigates if certain types of learning styles correlate to student conceptual learning in undergraduate dynamics. Each of the students (86 last quarter) in the course took the index of learning styles (ILS) based on the Felder-Silverman model. The ILS assesses student preferences on four key dimensions: active/reflective, sensing/intuitive, visual/verbal, and sequential/global. Although some may argue on which learning styles model is the most appropriate, the ILS has been validated and reported often in the literature. Student scores on each of the four dimensions were recorded on the numerical score of 1-11. We have assessed student conceptual understanding by administering the dynamics concept inventory (DCI) before and after the course. The scores on the DCI were correlated to student learning styles.","0190-5848;2377-634X","978-1-4244-4715-2978-1-4244-4714","10.1109/FIE.2009.5350822","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5350822","conceptual knowledge;learning styles","Education;Equations;Testing;Power engineering and energy;Knowledge engineering;Engineering profession;Cognitive science;Problem-solving;Wheels;Kinetic energy","educational courses;engineering education;teaching","dynamics concept inventory;teaching;educational course;student conceptual learning style;index of learning styles;Felder-Silverman model;learning styles model","","3","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, the practice or problems presented in CAI were usually limited to simple drill-and-practice questions after which the student is then given the next module depending on his score in the evaluation of the module.

However, small sample size and the inherently high inclination of the sample population to succeed were likely high contributing factors. Further, preferences are adaptable by education, and this study was conducted with advanced students. We are interested in the correlations between learning style preferences, task perception, and student performance in the context of an introductory chemical engineering material balances course. Assignments have a natural degree of learning style bias, and we are looking to see if student preferences correlate with their performance and perceptions when these biases are considered. Results will provide evidence regarding whether learning styles can affect student performance, as well as identify naturally occurring biases in chemical engineering problems that are translatable to other fields.

Interactive simulations (free or textbook-based) are widely used across the undergraduate engineering curriculum to help actively engaged students increase their understanding of abstract concepts or phenomena which are not directly or easily observable. However, there are indications in the literature that we do not yet know the pedagogical best practices associated with their use to maximize learning. This project couples student use of interactive simulations with the gathering of real-time formative assessment via pen-enabled mobile technology (in this case, Tablet PCs). The research question addressed in this paper is: are learning gains achieved with this coupled model greater for certain types of learners in the undergraduate engineering classroom? To answer this, we correlate learning gains with various learning styles, as identified using the Index of Learning Styles (ILS) developed by Felder and Soloman. These insights will be useful for others who use interactive computer simulations in their instruction and other adopters of this pedagogical model; the insights may have broader implications about modification of instruction to address various learning styles.","0190-5848;0190-5848;2377-634X","978-1-4673-1352-0978-1-4673-1353-7978-1-4673-1351","10.1109/FIE.2012.6462281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6462281","learning styles;interactive simulations;real-time formative assessment;active learning;InkSurvey","Computational modeling;Real-time systems;Engineering education;Physics;Integrated circuit modeling;Reliability","computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;mobile computing;physics computing","student learning styles effect;learning gains;interactive simulations;real-time formative assessment;pen-enabled mobile technology;undergraduate engineering physics;interactive computer simulations;undergraduate engineering curriculum;pedagogical best practices;undergraduate engineering classroom;index of learning styles","","1","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are many learning styles and teachers are usually unable to deliver learning material that matches every possible combination. In this context, several tools, called Adaptive Hypermedia Systems (AHS), have been developed to automatically adapt and recommend learning material according to the students' learning styles. In recent years, educational video games have been used to motivate and engage students, providing a promising form of instruction. However, these video games possess several features. Thus, a particular educational video game could be preferred by a student with a specific learning style, but not by other student with a different style. For this reason, we analyze which students' behaviors described by Felder's learning styles are related to educational video game features. Moreover, we developed an approach to recommend educational video games whose features match the students' learning styles. Experimental results obtained from a population of undergraduate Computer Science students showed several relations between educational video games features and students' behaviors.","","978-1-4673-9765-0978-1-4673-9764-3978-1-4673-9766","10.1109/ARGENCON.2016.7585274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7585274","","Games;Education;Context;Visualization;Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Computer science","","","","","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We designed an experiment to compare the performance of students in flipped classroom with traditional teaching method. This experiment involves a total of 35 students. The students were divided into two separate classes (01 and 1E) taught by the same professor with the same contents and assessment methods. Students in Class 01 are the `experiment group' and were taught with flipped method, while students in Class 1E are the `control group' and were taught with traditional method. Data was collected from three components of student assessment (Participation, Homework, and Exam) and questionnaire; we used the questionnaire to group students by their preferred learning styles. The key findings after data analysis include a) Students in flipped classroom achieved 7% higher `Participation Grade' than their peers in traditional. b) Students in traditional classroom achieved 17% higher `Homework Grade' and 6% higher `Exam Grade' than their peers in flipped classroom. c) Logical Learners outperformed Visual Learners by 10% in flipped classroom. Further, we discussed the implications of these findings to practice. We expect this paper to be useful and informative to higher education instructors who adopt or plan to adopt flipped classroom in their courses.","","978-1-5090-5920-1978-1-5090-5919-5978-1-5090-4920","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190522","","Education;Business;Online services;Multimedia communication;Problem-solving;Writing","computer aided instruction;data analysis;educational courses;educational technology;student experiments","flipped classroom;student performance;learning styles;flipped pedagogy;data analysis;higher education;educational courses;student assessment","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Every e-learning system is designed with a goal to help the student to establish his/her goals and help them when needed. But, the learning style of each student is different, consequently, learning progression and pattern varies among students. A learning style is a characteristic of psychological and cognitive behavior of a user under a learning phase. Hence, a good e-learning system is one which not only recommends concept based on knowledge level but also recommends the type of learning material which will help the student to learn or acquire a skill in the best way.

In this paper, Bijective soft set algorithm is used in classifying students learning style based on Felder Silverman learning style model. The discernible matrix parameter reduction was used to generate attributes reducts, whereby rules were generated from these reducts. Experiments were carried out using simulated data with various attributes that represent student's characteristics according to the four dimensions of Felder Silverman model.

Six modules in history and engineering were designed in verbal, visual and multimedia modes. Hundred and four undergraduate students of the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur participated and completed the six modules. The performance in each module was assessed on the basis of recall, recognition, comprehension, and transfer of learning. Based on Inventory of Learning Styles, learners were categorized in visual-verbal and sequential-global dimensions. The verbal, neutral, and visual learners and the sequential, neutral, and global learners did not differ in performance across disciplines. Learners' performance in visual mode for history and in multimedia mode for engineering was found to be superior to other modes. High academic achievers performed better for recognition and comprehension dimensions in history, and recognition dimension in engineering than low academic achievers. Irrespective of learning styles or academic achievements students preferred and found more appropriate visual and multimedia modes over verbal mode of learning. We believe that the null results for learning styles suggest their limited usability for adaptive hypermedia. Similarly, Mayer's multimedia learning cannot be recommended as the most effective mode of learning for all disciplines. We suggest that adaptivity according to disciplines is an important area that needs to be explored.","","978-1-4673-4369-5978-1-4673-4367-1978-1-4673-4368","10.1109/IHCI.2012.6481811","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6481811","learning preference;learning styles;adaptive hypermedia;visual-verbal;sequential-global;history;engineering","Multimedia communication;Visualization;History;Animation;Materials;Indexes;Education","computer aided instruction;hypermedia;multimedia computing","learning styles;academic achievement;different learning modes;adaptive hypermedia approach;Felder-Silverman learning styles;Mayer generative theory;multimedia learning;multimedia modes;visual modes;verbal modes;undergraduate students;Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur;multimedia mode","","2","48","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Learning styles and multiple intelligence theories have been widely used in student modeling to show how a student ad quires knowledge and highlights special learning abilities. Through the bringing together of these two areas of learning a picture of an individual student can be made. This information therefore becomes useful for a tutor to adapt the learning process to the student.

In this paper, we analyze the behavior of 43 students based on their learning styles and predefined patterns of behavior. Firstly, we concentrated on whether students with different learning style preferences act differently in the course. This information can be used to create courses that include features for each learning style. Secondly, we investigated correlations between the learning style preferences and the behavior of students during the course.

A recent extension to ITS is to capture student learning styles using a questionnaire and adapt subject content accordingly, however students do not always take the time to complete questionnaires carefully. This paper describes Oscar, a conversational intelligent tutoring system (CITS) which utilises a conversational agent to conduct the tutoring. The CITS aims to mimic a human tutor by dynamically estimating and adapting to a student's learning style during a tutoring conversation. Oscar also offers intelligent solution analysis and problem support for learners. By implicitly modelling the student's learning style during tutoring, Oscar can personalise tutoring to each individual learner to improve the effectiveness of the tutoring. The paper presents the novel methodology and architecture for constructing a CITS. An initial pilot study has been conducted in the domain of tutoring of undergraduate Science and Engineering students using the Index of Learning Styles ILS) model.

In this paper, we present a study to evaluate an advanced adaptive mechanism that extends LMSs with adaptive functionality to automatically provide students with courses that fit their learning styles. The results of this study showed two significant benefits of the adaptive mechanism for students: receiving higher grades on adaptive lessons than on non-adaptive ones while spending a similar amount of time on both, and spending less time on adaptive lessons than on non-adaptive ones while receiving on average the same grades.

The current model of open learning has certain limitations which provide potential for improvement. One such area is personalization in learning environments. One avenue to enhance learning experience in open learning environments is giving consideration to learning principles and cognitive science. This paper aims to introduce a proposal for an adaptive model to personalize the open learning environments based on the theory of learning styles and particularly the Felder and Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM). This model consists of two main agents to perform its functionalities. First, the identification agent which is responsible of identifying the learners' learning styles by monitoring certain determined patterns of learners' behaviors with learning objects while the learner interact with learning materials. Second, the recommender agent which is responsible of providing an adaptable navigational support based on the identified learning styles and preferences. The paper presents a description of the model and its functionalities including the patterns that can be monitored in open learning environments to identify the learning styles and also how the adaptation support can be provided based on the identified styles.

This information can be useful in scenarios of face-to-face learning, blended learning or e-learning. In the context of e-learning, we find this information particularly useful for two purposes. Firstly, it allows the detection of potential students or groups with risk to fail when trying to achieve academic objectives and, therefore, makes it possible to prevent them from failing, by offering them personalized assistance in advance.

This results in teacher understanding about each student’s learning preferences and behavior, which exhibits, for instance, students’ learning styles and affective states. On the other hand, identification of learning styles and affective states in web-based learning environments is quite challenging. The existing approaches for the identification of learning styles such as questionnaire is not without limitations. Similarly, affective states identification approaches mentioned in the literature indicate several shortcomings. This paper proposes an automatic approach for the identification of learning styles and affective states in web-based Learning Management Systems (LMSs). The unique feature of this approach is that it is generic in nature. Using this approach, the students learning styles and affective states are calculated automatically from their learning preferences and behavior within a course. Evaluation of this approach was performed by following a study with 81 students. The results of the study were then compared with the learning styles and affective states questionnaires, which demonstrate that the suggested approach is more appropriate for the identification of learning styles and affective states. Therefore, using this approach, a tool (AsLim) has been developed and can be used by the teachers for the identification of learning styles and affective states of their students.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2937178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812729","Learning Management Systems (LMSs);Learning Styles;Affective States;Adaptivity;Personalization","Hidden Markov models;Adaptation models;Data models;Learning management systems;Task analysis;Adaptive systems;Licenses","","","","","","CCBY","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This paper demonstrates how the consideration of cognitive traits such as working memory capacity (WMC) can help in detecting learning styles. Previous studies have identified a relationship between learning styles and cognitive traits. In this paper, the practical application of this relationship is described and its potential to improve the detection of learning styles by additionally including data from cognitive traits in the calculation process is discussed. An extended approach and architecture for identifying learning styles which consider cognitive traits is also introduced. Furthermore, an experiment has been conducted that shows the positive effect of considering WMC in the detection process of learning styles for two out of three learning style dimensions, leading to higher precision of the results and therefore more accurate identification of learning styles which in turn lead to more accurate adaptivity for students.","2378-3915;1529-4188","978-1-4244-8049","10.1109/DEXA.2010.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5592009","adaptivity in learning systems;cognitive traits;working memory capacity;learning styles","Learning systems;Adaptation model;Sensors;Adaptive systems;Visualization;Electronic learning","cognition;computer aided instruction;educational courses","cognitive trait;student learning style detection;online course;working memory capacity;WMC","","8","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, there is no report of research where one-on-one education is implemented. Moreover, there are no references about the match of a trainees' LS to their tutors' IS and the correlation of this LS-IS match with the trainees' achievements as presented in the current paper. To measure the LS- IS match, two different methods were used. First, calculating the correlation between trainees' LS and tutors' IS (LS-IS correlation); second, calculating the LS-IS distance. Thirty-nine tutors were paired with 42 trainees with learning disabilities (three tutors had two trainees each) during the 2016 academic year. Thus, 42 pairs of tutors and trainees worked to help the trainees achieve better academic grades. The Felder-Soloman Index of Learning Styles (ILS) was used to measure the tutors' preferred IS and the trainees' preferred LS. In both methods, the LS-IS match was correlated with the trainees' grades. If the LS-IS match influences the trainees' achievements, significant positive correlations in the first method and significant negative correlation in the second method must appear.

To this end, this paper presents an approach to integrate learning styles into adaptive e-learning hypermedia. The main objectives were to develop a Learning Style based Adaptive E-learning Hypermedia System (LS-AEHS) and assess the effect of adapting educational materials individualized to the student's learning style. In this work, our main goal aims to adopting the theory of experiential learning in the context of the DAVID KOLB's model to pass of this learning style model to define the adaptation rules in order to adapt the learning content and the navigation to each learning style in KOLB model. To achieve the main objectives, a case study was developed.

Generally, the traditional way of detecting students' learning style is based on asking students to fill out a questionnaire. However, using this static technique presents many problems. Some of these problems include the lack of self-awareness of students of their learning preferences. In addition, almost all students are bored when they are asked to fill out a questionnaire.

We propose a learner model with three components: the learner's profile, learner's knowledge, and learner's educational preferences. The learner's profile represents the learner's general information such as identification data, the learner's knowledge implies the learner's interests on visited learning objects, and the learner's educational preferences are composed of the learner's preferences among visited learning objects and his/her learning style. In the proposed approach, all learner model components are automatically detected, without requiring explicit feedback. Indeed, all the basic learners' information is inferred from the learners' online activities and usage data, based on web usage mining techniques and a literature-based approach for the automatic detection of learning styles in learning management systems. Once learner models are built, we apply a hierarchical multi-level model based collaborative filtering approach, in order to gather learners with similar preferences and interests in the same groups.","2161-3761;2161-377X","978-0-7695-5009","10.1109/ICALT.2013.123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6601965","Learner Modeling;Learning Styles;Recommender Systems;Web Mining;Collaborative Filtering","Computational modeling;Collaboration;Frequency measurement;Least squares approximations;Vectors;Filtering;Educational institutions","collaborative filtering;computer aided instruction;data mining;recommender systems","fully automatic learner modeling approach;learning management systems;learner educational preferences;composite learner model;learner profile;learner knowledge;learner information;online learner activities;Web usage mining techniques;literature-based approach;automatic learning style detection;hierarchical multilevel model based collaborative filtering approach","","4","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there is little research evidence on the adoption and adaptation of learning styles in an e-learning environment, specifically in respect of personalised learning environments. In this context, evidence identifies that the more thoroughly instructors understand the differences in learning styles, the better chance they have of meeting the diverse learning needs of learners. In this respect, providing learners with learning environments that suit their learning style can have positive impact on learning effectiveness. Many learning styles inventories/instruments have attempted to augment learners' learning styles with learning methods, albeit without taking on board the criticism levied at inventories and similar instruments in terms of reliability and validity(including the rubrics behind the models of learning styles). This paper identifies the process of amalgamating three existing models of learning styles (Kolb; Honey and Mumford; and Felder and Solomon), into a `diagnostic questionnaire' learning style inventory for reflection and discussion.","","978-1-4244-5402-0978-1-4244-5401","10.1109/DeSE.2009.41","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5395132","learning styles inventories;models of learning styles;personalised learning environments;e-learning","Electronic learning;Education;Learning systems;Instruments;Prototypes;Psychology;Lifting equipment;Position measurement","computer aided instruction","educational theorists;e-learning environment;personalised learning environments;diagnostic questionnaire learning style inventory;learning styles theory;learning methods","","3","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This helps reduce the rework during the later stages of software development. While inspections are effective in practice, the evidence suggests that the effectiveness of inspectors varies widely. Cognitive psychologists have used Learning Style (LS) to show the improvement in student's score by considering their characteristic strength and preferences to acquire and process information. This concept of LS can cross over to software engineering as a means of increasing the inspection effectiveness. This paper investigates the effect of the LS of inspectors on fault detection abilities of inspection teams and individual inspectors. Using the inspection data with varying number of participants, we analyzed the effect of the LS of inspectors across various inspection team sizes on the inspection performance. We also analyzed the effect of LS categories on the individual inspection performance. The initial results show that the teams composed of inspectors with different LS preferences are more effective and efficient than the teams of inspectors who had similar LS's. The results also provide insights into the LS categories that favor requirements inspection.","1071-9458;2332-6549","978-1-4799-2366","10.1109/ISSRE.2013.6698886","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6698886","inspection;learning style;requirements","Inspection;Software;Principal component analysis;Visualization;Software engineering;Instruments;Sensors","formal specification;inspection;software reliability","software development;software engineering;learning style;inspection effectiveness;fault detection abilities;inspection teams;individual inspectors;inspection data;inspection performance;LS categories;software requirements inspection","","2","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When considering collaborative learning environment through online chat and discussion, the learners can express their opinion on a shared learning object. Besides, level of interaction with the object is also important to identify the learning style. The nature of generated contents during discussion makes it difficult to extract the required information. In this paper we discuss how to identify the learning style from the learning object preferences expressed by the learner via the online discussion in a collaborative learning platform. To do so, the paper proposes an ontology-based Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model to represent the relationship between the learning style and preferable learning object. The model also obtains the learner's opinion more than one time by using time slice to make the indication of learning styles more accurate. Consequently, providing the learner the appropriate personalized learning package.","","978-1-5386-4152-1978-1-5386-4151-4978-1-5386-4153","10.1109/CSIT.2018.8486169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8486169","Learning Style Model;learning object;Collaborative Learning;Ontology-based Dynamic Bayesian Network","Bayes methods;Collaborative work;Adaptation models;Computer science;Tools;Data mining;Ontologies","belief networks;computer aided instruction;groupware;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","personalized e-learning;learning style;learning object preferences;collaborative learning platform;collaborative learning environment;ontology-based dynamic Bayesian network model;personalized learning package;chat conversation;online chat;online discussion;learners opinion","","1","42","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two versions of an educational game have been developed based on the sequential/global dimension of the learning style proposed by Felder and Silverman. The experimental results show that the learning motivation of the students who learn with the learning style-fit version is significantly higher than that of those learn with non-fir version, implying that proper design of educational computer game based on learning styles is helpful to students in promoting their motivation and learning achievement.","","978-1-4673-2719-0978-0-7695-4826","10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2012.59","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6337199","learning styles;cognitive process;human factors;educational computer games;adaptive learning","Games;Computers;Educational institutions;Adaptive systems;Learning systems;Educational technology","computer aided instruction;computer games;human factors","student motivation;learning achievement;digital game-based learning;human factor;educational computer game;learning motivation;learning style-fit version","","6","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we introduce a mechanism for extending LMSs' functionality to provide learners with courses that fit their individual learning styles, using adaptive sorting and adaptive annotation in order to highlight the learning objects (LOs) that support students' learning process the best. The mechanism enables teachers to add adaptivity to their already existing courses, using a flexible course structure in order to avoid limiting the richness of the learning resources and materials. Besides being flexible to teachers' needs, the adaptive mechanism aims at asking teachers for as little as possible additional effort when using it, requiring teachers only to choose the corresponding type of LO when creating an LO in the authoring tool of the LMS.","2161-3761;2161-377X","978-1-4244-7145-4978-1-4244-7144-7978-0-7695-4055","10.1109/ICALT.2010.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5571112","Adaptivity;Learning Management Systems;Learning Styles","Materials;Adaptive systems;Animation;Adaptation model;Reflection;Sensors;Learning systems","adaptive systems;computer aided instruction;educational courses;information resources;learning systems","learning management systems;online courses;individual learning styles;adaptive sorting;adaptive annotation;learning objects;students learning process;flexible course structure;learning resources","","27","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We found that students in the course preferred active, sensing, visual and sequential learning styles. There was no significant difference in the course completion rates along any dimension that could not be explained based on prior preparation. Reflective and intuitive learners earned better grades in the course than active and sensing learners. While male students earned better grades than female students and traditionally represented students earned better grades than underrepresented students, these differences may be attributable to differences in prior preparation. In this context, SAT scores were found to be better predictors of student grades in Computer Science I than high school GPA. Programming projects in the course favored reflective students whereas online assignments favored sensing and sequential learners - unsurprising, since the design of these course instruments were congruent with the definition of these learning styles. It is hoped that this study provides insight into the types of course activities that might be incorporated into Computer Science I to accommodate the different learning styles of students.","","978-1-5090-5920-1978-1-5090-5919-5978-1-5090-4920","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190464","Online tutors;Felder-Silverman Learning Style Inventory","Sensors;Visualization;Programming;Sociology;Analysis of variance","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;student experiments","learning styles;Computer Science I course;sequential learning","","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper focuses on analysing the learning achievements and collaboration processes for the two types of groups, particularly with respect to the quality of group interactions. A significant difference was found between the percentages of time spent on meaningful interactions by the two types of groups, revealing that diverse learning style groups tend to spend significantly more time on meaningful interactions than similar learning style groups.

We ran an experiment with students of a technical degree of web development in a course of Programming Introduction using Python. Preliminary findings revealed that their learning styles are mainly active and visual, and learners who are more verbal or have stronger concrete experience obtained higher scores in their tests.

We also found that those subjects who are more efficient in solving formal inference tasks obtained higher qualifications in their exams. The findings can be useful not only for didactic transposition in teaching courses which take into account the balance of the students' preference but also to develop new instructional methods and software which focus on the cognitive preferences and cognitive process of technicians.","","978-1-4799-0783-0978-1-4799-0781","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2013.6622225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6622225","Learning Style Models;Formal Inferences;Cognitive Process;Information Acquisition","Educational institutions;Cognition;Abstracts;Programming;Visualization;Concrete","computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;inference mechanisms","learning style preference;cognitive process;instructional software;instructional methods;student preference;visual learning style;active learning style;Python;programming introduction course;Web development technical degree;technical degree denomination;Argentinian national universities;formal inference","","1","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Learning Strategies and Learning Styles","J. Heywood","Trinty College, The Univ. of Dublin","Engineering Education: Research and Development in Curriculum and Instruction","","2005","","","","","The reader who approaches this topic for the first time may be confused by the usage of the terms?>cognitive style?> and?>learning style.?> Snow, Corno, and Jackson (1996), under the heading?>personal styles?>, write that?>no category we have covered contains a more voluminous, complex and controversy-laced literature than that of personal styles.. They classified the kinds of constructs that have been studied under six headings. These are:?>Cognitive styles?> involved in perception and thinking (e.g. field independence versus dependence, reflection versus impulsivity.?>Learning styles?> involved in approaches to learning and studying (e.g,. deep versus surface processing, comprehension learning versus operation learning).?>Expressive styles,?> involved in verbal or nonverbal communication (e.g. tempo, constricted versus expansive).?>Response styles?> involved in self-perception and self-report (e.g., acquiescence, deception).?>Defensive styles?> involved in accommodating anxiety and conflict (e.g. obsessive-compulsive, hysterical),?>Cognitive controls?> a subset of style like but function-specific and unipolar controls on attention and behavior (e.g. constricted versus flexible control)?> (p. 281).Riding and Rayner (1998) argued that learning styles are a subset of cognitive styles, and in this they agreed with Sternberg and Grigorenko (1997), who also reviewed the literature on this concept. Sternberg and Grigorenko classified styles as cognition centered, personality centered, or activity centered. Those that are cognition centered have a relationship with ability and measures of intelligence, The MBTI personality measure that has been much used among engineering students is as its focus implies personality centered. The other instrument that has appealed to engineers, The Learning Styles Inventory (Kolb) is activity-centered.It is a consolation to this writer that Snow, Corno and Jackson (1996) decided not to make any sharp distinction between learning styles and cognitive styles, or between styles and approaches. Nevertheless, I have made some distinctions and begin with a discussion of learning strategies.Learning strategies are devices that we use to cope with the learning environments we find ourselves in. Learning styles are dispositions we have to learning. They are preferred ways of organizing what we see and think. The Chapter begins with a discussion of strategies, and in particular deep and surface approaches to learning. It has been shown that learning environments and, in particular, the assessments used can have a harmful or less than positive effect on learning, as, for example, if they cause surface learning. For this reason the effects of an outcomes-based approach to assessment needs to be evaluated in terms of its effects on learning. From the perspective of engineering it has been shown that engineers require a variety of learning styles when they are engaged in projects. They need, for example, to be both convergent and divergent thinkers. The case for this view is presented. A brief discussion of field-independent and field-dependent styles of thinking follows. Although spatial ability is not strictly speaking a style, it is important in engineering design. Engineers need to be able to visualize, and consequently they need a highly developed spatial ability.Therefore, since we have predispositions to learn, the style that we have may be in conflict with the style of teaching to which we are exposed, a major question is whether teaching and learning styles should be matched. Given that engineers need a variety of styles, it is incumbent on teachers to foster their development, and that suggests teachers may have to change their teaching styles. Engineers have used a number of instruments to determine the learning styles of their students. These include Kolb's Learning Styles Inventory and a summary of work that has been done to use it as a scheme for the design of instruction is given. Variations of the Kolb model are summarized in particular the 4 MAT scheme and Honey and Mumford model.Felder and Silverman identified 32 learning styles and developed an inventory to test for these among engineering students. This is discussed. Style and personality are related and influence the way we learn in particular environments. Engineers have been particularly interested in the Myers Briggs Personality Indicator, and much is known about the personality profiles of engineering students from this test. The investigations among engineering students are summarized. Temperament evidently influences performance but to some extent as a function of the culture of the learning environment.Other sections of the Chapter discuss cognitive styles analysis, the relationship between course structure and learning styles and learning strategies, learning styles and individualised environments. The review supports a point made by Hein and Budny (1999) that the learning style assessment tool used is not as critical as the assessment of learning styles. It illustrates the complexity of the learning process that teachers have to face when they guide the learning of a diverse group of students. Overall the reported research supports the need for variety in teaching and learning not only for the sake of learning but for preparation for work in industry. It also supports the case for multiple strategy approaches to the assessment of student learning.","","978047174469604717446","10.1109/9780471744696.ch5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE",""

In this paper, we look at the relationship between individuals' preference for receiving information and their methods of sending information. It was initially anticipated that each individual's mode of presenting information would match his or her preferred mode of receiving information, and that this match would result in improved communication. To study the congruency (or incongruency) of how individuals prefer to receive information and how they go about sending information, an experiment was designed and conducted. The experiment consisted of four teams of engineering educators engaged in a design exercise. Their design activities were videotaped. Results based on analysis of the tapes and individual learning styles inventories showed that most participants preferred to receive information visually and engaged in drawing very little during the design exercise. If the definition was expanded to include using drawings, communicative gesturing (i.e. using hand gestures to describe a physical object or action), using hardware and referencing hardware, then visual communication went from comprising an average of 3.8% of the design time to an average of 21.1% of the design time.","0190-5848","0-7803-6424","10.1109/FIE.2000.897593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=897593","","Design engineering;Hardware;Visual communication;Space exploration;Engineering students;Communication effectiveness;Information analysis;Engineering drawings;Process design;Chemical engineering","design engineering;engineering education;professional communication;human factors","learning styles;group design work;design team member communication;information transfer;information receiving;information sending;information processing;information presentation;individual preferences;engineering educators;videotaping;learning styles inventories;visual information;drawings;communicative gesturing;hand gestures;hardware;referencing;visual communication","","1","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This was conducted in the course “Physics of materials”, in which we analyzed the contribution of practical experience in the learning process. The study aims to assess the degree of interest, motivation and understanding by students on academic content, which is often abstract, and of which practical demonstrations with resources prepared by 3D printing can become a learning facilitator. To this end, the learning styles of students were determined through the Honey-Alonso Learning Styles Questionnaire (CHAEA). This questionnaire allows teachers and students to know the learning styles and how each student interacts and relates in group activities. It includes a section on practical experience, motivation and the acquisition of knowledge of the students, who were unanimous in ranking high the importance of 3D printing technology in teaching activities in the classroom. As a collaborative learning resource, it is concluded that 3D printing can positively help teachers establish an improved teaching environment for students by including different methodological styles in the learning process. This is particularly effective in courses with a significant theoretical content. The increasing availability of 3D printing combined with the motivational aspect of its usage as a learning facilitator establish a revolutionary and powerful resource for active learning.","","978-1-5090-3912-8978-1-5090-3913","10.1109/CISPEE.2016.7777742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7777742","3D printing;Teaching methods;Learning styles;Experiential learning;Active learning","Education;Pragmatics;Printers;Collaboration;Physics","educational courses;engineering education;further education;industrial engineering;teaching;three-dimensional printing","collaborative use;learning styles;3D printing technologies;collaborative resource;higher education teaching;industrial design degree;Physics of materials;academic content;learning facilitator;Honey-Alonso Learning Styles Questionnaire;CHAEA;group activities;knowledge acquisition;teaching activities;collaborative learning resource;teaching environment","","4","50","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Studies in Cognitive Psychology and Pedagogy have already reported that each individual has a specific Learning Style, which describes her/his best means of perceiving and acquiring knowledge. The detection of the personal Learning Style of each student has long been made by using questionnaires; an analysis that demands too much effort, mainly in courses with hundreds of students. Therefore, the automatic modeling of learning styles has gained attention in the computing and education areas. This study compares different Machine Learning algorithms for the detection of students' Learning Styles. As such, a dataset is extracted from a real course in the Moodle learning platform. This course had 105 students interacting with 252 learning objects during 12 months. The learning styles were described using the classic model of Felder-Silverman. According to the experimental results using these data, a single machine learning algorithm was not able to induce models with predictive accuracy comparable to those from existing alternatives. However, when models from different algorithms were combined, it was possible to obtain a predictive accuracy superior to those reported in the related literature.","2377-634X;1539-4565","978-1-5386-1174-6978-1-5386-1175","10.1109/FIE.2018.8659191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8659191","","Learning management systems;Machine learning algorithms;Organizations;Adaptation models;Visualization;Machine learning","learning (artificial intelligence);learning management systems;psychology","Moodle learning platform;machine learning techniques;learning management system;personal learning style;cognitive psychology;learning styles automatic modeling","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, delivering personalised course learning objects based on student’s preferences is still a challenge. Current mainstream recommendation algorithms, such as the Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Content-Based Filtering (CBF), deal with only two types of entities, namely users and items with their ratings. However, these methods do not pay attention to student’s preferences, such as learning styles, which are especially important for the accuracy of course learning objects prediction or recommendation. Moreover, several recommendation techniques experience cold-start and rating sparsity problems. To address the challenge of improving the quality of recommender systems, in this paper a novel recommender algorithm for machine learning is proposed, which combines students actual rating with their learning styles to recommend personalised course learning objects (LOs). Various recommendation techniques are considered in an experimental study investigating the best technique to use in predicting student ratings for e-learning recommender systems. We use the Felder-Silverman Learning Styles Model (FSLSM) to represent both the student learning styles and the learning object profiles. The predicted ratings are compared with the actual student ratings to determine the accuracy of the recommendation techniques, using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metrics. This approach has been experimented on 80 students for an online course created in the MOODLE Learning Management System. The results of the experiment show that the best recommendation technique is our proposed hybrid recommendation algorithm that combines the collaborative filtering and the content-based filtering techniques to enhance the accuracy of the predictions, and solves the cold-start and the rating sparsity problems using the FSLSM representations of the student learning styles and the learning object profiles.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2935417","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8798626","Collaborative Filtering (CF);Content-Based Filtering (CBF);E-learning;Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM);Hybrid Filtering (HF);Rating prediction;Recommendation system","","","","","","","CCBY","","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

First of all, the authors performed systematic review on intelligent software agents' application in education. After that, they have analysed students' preferences to certain learning styles according to Felder and Silverman Learning Styles Model which is widely recognised the most suitable for engineering disciplines. This analysis is necessary to further creating personalised learning units / scenarios optimised for particular learners in conformity with their learning styles and other preferences. These learning units should consist of suitable learning components (learning objects, learning activities, and learning environments) optimal for particular students. Scientific methodology to creating optimised learning units for particular learners is based on expert evaluation method and application of intelligent technologies - ontologies, recommender systems, and intelligent software agents. The novel model of personalised intelligent learning system for engineering students based on application of intelligent software agents is presented in more detail.

Recommender systems (RSs) for technology-enhanced learning (TEL) are among those new technologies that have been researched extensively within the past few years. This is because RSs for TEL are intelligent decision support systems that assist internet users in finding suitable learning objects that might match their preferences on the kinds of materials they could require to enhanced their learning activities. However, most of the existing RSs for learning used traditional techniques (2-dimensional user × item, techniques) to recommend learning objects to users without considering the contexts in which the recommendation should be made. Those contexts could be the geographical locations, the level of education, the time of the day or week, their learning preferences, and so on. This paper proposed a conceptual framework of smart media-based context-aware RSs for learning that could consider the learning preferences of users as a context for making accurate and usable recommendations. The proposed system was designed to run on smart devices for learners to test and know their learning styles and receive learning object recommendations according to their learning preferences.

Several researchers focus on the theory of teamwork organizations, based on academic performances, learning styles, learning settings, gender, etc. Therefore, grouping learners based on their predicted academic performance level in each subject separately may be more effective in a collaborative learning environment, but it still a challenging subject. First of all, we present in this paper a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the relevant studies that address the problem of predicting academic performance and to extract the used data mining methods such as Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, etc. At the beginning, a set of 658 papers were selected. After applying the different SLR's steps, this selection has been filtered to 12 papers using specific selection criteria and a careful analysis of each paper. Then, the selected studies were used to answer the defined research questions. Finally, synthesis data, current research gaps and recommendations for further work are discussed in this paper.","","978-1-5090-0778-3978-1-5090-0777-6978-1-5090-0779","10.1109/ITHET.2016.7760756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7760756","E-learning;Collaborative learning;Teamwork;Systematic literature review;Data mining","Data mining;Decision trees;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Teamwork;Bibliographies;Education","computer aided instruction;data mining;groupware;team working","selection criteria;support vector machine;neural network;naïve Bayes;decision tree;data mining;SLR;systematic literature review;collaborative learning environment;academic performance level;gender;learning settings;learning styles;teamwork organizations;learning groups;e-learning system;teamwork construction","","3","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been acknowledged over a period of time that students from different backgrounds have different learning styles and that alternate teaching methodology and styles can aid the learning process. The diverse environment offered within educational institutions in UAE raises a challenge for the educators to provide an effective classroom setup to maximize individual student satisfaction and performance while enabling them to recognize their own cognitive skillset. The objective was an analysis of the association between cultural diversity and satisfaction of engineering students. The approach involved collection and extraction of relevant data from two survey questionnaires. A sample size of 113 students was recorded for the surveys. The data from the surveys was tested against several hypothesis and the results indicated that cultural diversity had significant correlation with university satisfaction and therefore recommendations for future work were also presented.","2470-6698;2374-0191","978-1-5386-6522-0978-1-5386-6521-3978-1-5386-6523","10.1109/TALE.2018.8615206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8615206","students' satisfaction;cultural diversity;engineering education","Cultural differences;Engineering students;Correlation;Sociology;Australia","computer aided instruction;cultural aspects;educational institutions;engineering education;teaching","cultural diversity;engineering students;survey questionnaires;significant correlation;university satisfaction;culturally diverse university;technical material;learning process;diverse environment;educational institutions;effective classroom setup;individual student satisfaction;cognitive skillset;learning styles;teaching methodology","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A resource for teaching a Learning-Styles/Teamwork module with the soloman-felder index of learning styles","J. E. Sharp","Dept. of Chem.

After presenting a rationale for the module, I suggest in-class activities and homework assignments from which instructors can construct their own module of up to three one-hour segments. This resource is adapted from a module I created for the Vanderbilt Engineering School ES 130 freshman introductory course, and has been endorsed by Prof. Richard Felder. At his suggestion, I have included a problem-solving exercise with the thinking/feeling dimension of the Myers-Briggs personality theory, a dimension affecting interpersonal conflicts.","1045-9243;1558-4143","","10.1109/MAP.2004.1396766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1396766","","Teamwork;Testing;Switches;Auditory system;Chemical engineering;USA Councils;Problem-solving;Electrical engineering education;Design engineering;Instruments","electrical engineering education;teaching","teaching resource;learning-style;teamwork module;Soloman-Felder index;electrical engineering education","","3","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
