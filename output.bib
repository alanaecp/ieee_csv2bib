        abstract = { Recommender Systems (RSs) are information filtering systems that gather data about users, to build useful recommendations for them. In todays age of bigdata, RSs have become important tools for finding relevant items from numerous options. RSs for web-based learning assist learners in discovering relevant learning content, according to requirements. Since learners have diverse needs and contexts, recommendations need to be highly personalized. In web-based learning, MOOCs are globally accessible online courses, designed to support learning of a large number of students of different backgrounds. For modelling users, existing MOOC RSs focus on extrinsic properties such as demographics, ratings, whereas a students learning is more dependent on intrinsic qualities like competency, learning styles. In this work, a new RS prototype has been designed, for recommending MOOCs based on requirements and learning styles. This prototype is based on an adapted version of the FSLSM LS model and works exclusively for edX MOOCs. },

        abstract = { As RS (recommendation system) presents the advantage of adaptive recommendation, it is gradually applied to e-learning systems to recommend learners for the next learning content. Problems exist in current learning recommender system available to student in that they are often of a general learning content not offering a personalized service. To overcome this, An adaptive learning path recommendation system (ALPRS) is proposed comprising: (a) Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) is applied to acquire the key factors in learning content; (b) Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Model (ISM) is further utilized for establishing the adaptive learning path hierarchical structure; and (c) repertory grid technology (RGT) is further used for acquiring the effects of the recommender element attributes of the adaptive learning path. The result show that the learning outcome with ALPRS is better than it with general learning course guided recommendation mechanism, and the scores of system satisfaction with ALPRS and personal service are higher than 90; recall (95%), precision (68%), F1 index (45%), and MAE (8%) in ALPRS outperform other approaches. Finally, three contributions are organized in this study. (1) The novel hybrid ALPRS is proposed and tested the practicability. (2) A prototype gamification geometry teaching material module is developed for the promotion in MSTE (Mathematics, Science, and Technology Education) areas. (3) The adaptive geometry learning path diagram generated with ISM based on learning styles could offer reference for successive studies. },

Along with the development of technology, blended learning becomes very popular in education. A good blended learning is a blended learning that fits the current educational challenges of combining learning activities, supported by tools and technologies such as web 2.0 tools and recommender systems. In previous research, has been built a recommender system that recommends e-tivity, possible collaborators, web 2.0 tools, and bits of advice. The recommender system was built with collaborative filtering and content-based techniques. Collaborative filtering and content-based have problems in terms of dependency with data history, so it is possible to ramp-up and gray sheep on the recommendation. One way to overcome the problem of ramp-up and gray sheep is with knowledge-based. This paper proposes a knowledge-based recommender system to improve learning model in schools. Recommendations are based on VAK learning styles and collaborative learning theory. This research uses Design Research Methodology. The results showed that the experimental class score was higher than the control class. Using inferential statistics, it can be concluded that proposed knowledge-based recommender system significantly enhance learning in school. },

The work is then extended to examine how student interaction and student learning styles affect the learning outcomes. Different responses to the media combinations are observed and significant differences occur between learners classified as Sensing and Reflective learners. The experiment also identified some important differences in performance with the different media combinations by students registered as Dyslexic. The experiment was therefore repeated with a much larger sample of Dyslexic learners and the earlier effects were found to be significant. The results were surprising and may provide useful guidance for the design of material for Dyslexic students. },

Indeed, with their advent, we are assisting to a substantial expansion of online learning with new advantages such as: massiveness, openness, democratization of learning, etc. However, it raises particular issues related to the dropout rates and the heterogeneity of massive learner's cohorts. In this approach, we use neural networks for the identification and tracking of learner's learning styles in MOOCs so as to increase learners' engagement and satisfaction.

In fact they have the ability to adapt the learning process according to each learner needs, learning styles, objectives, etc. ALS_CORR[LP] is based on the learner prerequisites and the learning styles of Felder-Silverman, to design the learner model. As for the domain model, it is designed according to the recommendations of the differentiated pedagogy, which advocates creating multiple versions of the same learning object. Finally in order to ensure the adaptation inside the system, a Bayesian network, to match the designed learning object with the specifics of the learner profile was developed. It is also necessary to emphasize, that the major feature of the system is, its ability to correct the generated learning path in case of a failure in the evaluation phase. The learning path relevance is questioned, based on a recommendation system which enables updating the initial profile, or recommending the most relevant versions of the learning object, in case where the similarity calculation in behavior, reveals that the observed behavior in the system does not fit the initial profile description. },

This paper, proposes a novel and effective recommender algorithm that recommends personalised learning objects based on the student learning styles. Various similarity metrics are considered in an experimental study to investigate the best similarity metrics to use in a recommender system for learning objects. The approach is based on the Felder and Silverman learning style model which is used to represent both the student learning styles and the learning object profiles. It was found that the K-means clustering algorithm, the cosine similarity metrics and the Pearson correlation coefficient are effective tools for implementing learning object recommender systems. The accuracy of the recommendations are measured using traditional evaluation metrics, namely the Mean Absolute Error and the Root Mean Squared Error. },

Since the general student body consists of many different types of learning styles, these new tools can provide a means to reach a wider range of students than the traditional blackboard-based lectures. However, as a first step towards assessing the effectiveness of the tablet PC as a teaching tool, it is important to determine if it is well received by students of all learning styles. It is the purpose of this paper to report on the impact of the tablet PC on the students in four different courses, which were given over a period of three semesters. This impact was measured through a survey which was completed by the students at the end of each term. Overall, the students in all courses (a total sample size of 280) were quite positive about the use of the tablet, with 56% of the students stating that ¿The technology of the tablet...greatly improves my learning experience.¿ It was found that there were no statistically significant differences in how the students of different learning styles responded to the use of the tablet PC. In fact, all learning style groups reacted quite positively to its introduction into the classroom. However, some results indicate that a large group of students have a preference towards a more active classroom. This shows that if the tablet PC is to be an effective means of teaching, its advantages must be leveraged to facilitate an active-learning environment. },

An Asian learner who has never worked with computer-aided instruction may find it difficult to cope with learning the system while having to master the content delivered through the system.

When left to self-select, students often form homogenous groups with respect to several indicators, including learning style. While homogeneous groups may occasionally be preferred for specific tasks, heterogeneous groups have shown better performance over a wider range of tasks. Qualitative data (interviews) suggest that students grasp the value of heterogeneous groups and are able to recognize the gains of such diversity. We are interested in the relationship between learning styles and team dynamics in advanced chemical engineering students taking the team-based unit operations course. We are looking to correlate team composition with respect to learning styles preferences with team performance and student perceptions of team efficacy. Students are given a learning styles questionnaire to determine preferences in the course's lecture portion. These are used to identify potential correlations between team make-up, team performance and student perceptions during the subsequent laboratory portion. Understanding variability in performance based on team composition can help elucidate the complex nature of team dynamics. Armed with such information, instructors can create the most educationally efficient teams, and students will have a better understanding of teams as they enter the workforce. },

Students are introduced to the sound system of English and use computer-based tools to look at graphic representations of their own voice, comparing it to those of native speakers. Students learn how to diagnose their own pronunciation problems and develop skills so that they may continue their pronunciation development long after the course is finished through autonomous learning. },

It can be clearly seen in CanCore project [9] in Canada and the emerging of several standards of Learning Objects by well-known organizations such as IEEE. L3OP (Learning Objects Technology in Object-Oriented Programming ELearning System) project applies the Learning Objects concept into electronic learning system focusing on digitalizing learning styles (especially among higher education students). The electronic learning systems have been used by these students since past few generations and many of them have been enhanced. However, some students still feel that the electronic learning systems are not as effective as they may seem. The reason is varieties of traditional methods of learning styles used by these students, for example, jotting down and highlighting notes cannot be done in the electronic learning systems. For example, some students prefer to use highlight pen or marker to underline the important notes. However, the electronic learning systems can not digitize the styles. The project is only concentrated on visual type of learners. The Learning Objects approach used in this project not only to ensure the organization of the database but also the reusability of the learning content itself. },

Social Networks are increasingly becoming a ubiquitous characteristic of many learners and is often compared to a complementing platform to the more established learning management systems. In most conventional setups, learners have a diverse set of characteristics. One such - Learning styles, is often considered as necessary for ensuring productivity and learner satisfaction in a learning environment. This paper investigates learning styles used in a flipped classroom environment implemented with the aid of a popular social network. In the preliminary analysis, the learning styles of the learners are gathered through a computer-based test, and a simple feedback survey was carried out to evaluate whether the content presentation and flipped approach was satisfactory. The results in this case suggest that the satisfaction of students in a flipped classroom benefit from content prepared to match the selected learning styles of users (Visual). },

The knowledge about learning styles and emotional tendency are employed to find suitable teaching techniques and approaches. The study employs learning style that involves visual, aural, reading/writing, kinaesthetic (VARK) to identify the students learning styles. The results are that students' learning styles are classified in 13.33% visual, 36.67% aural, 20% read/write and 30% kinaesthetic. The emotional tendencies of the students are 33.33% positive, 53.33% neutral, 13.33% negative. The mapping concept based on the learning styles and emotional tendencies finds that positive emotional tendency is related to all learning styles. The neutral emotional tendency is related with aural, read/write, kinaesthetic. The negative emotional tendency is related to visual. },

Although professors can be quite good at teaching students how to choose the appropriate equation and calculate an answer, often these students do not come away from the course with a deep conceptual appreciation of the material. The current study investigates if certain types of learning styles correlate to student conceptual learning in undergraduate dynamics. Each of the students (86 last quarter) in the course took the index of learning styles (ILS) based on the Felder-Silverman model. The ILS assesses student preferences on four key dimensions: active/reflective, sensing/intuitive, visual/verbal, and sequential/global. Although some may argue on which learning styles model is the most appropriate, the ILS has been validated and reported often in the literature. Student scores on each of the four dimensions were recorded on the numerical score of 1-11. We have assessed student conceptual understanding by administering the dynamics concept inventory (DCI) before and after the course. The scores on the DCI were correlated to student learning styles. },

Making a historical in the evolution of Learning Styles, we see that some studies have compiled the various approaches to learning styles depending on the item to stress, psychological, cognitive, and so on. But little is known about studies that been devoted to relate the models proposed categorizations Learning Styles. Based on the foregoing, the study of the possible relationship between the categories proposed by Grasha - Riechmann (1976), Kolb (1974) and Alonso, Gallego and Honey (1991) was the primary purpose of this project and for this purpose test applied to the respective classification proposed by the same authors to sixty-three (63) students in engineering, then this information is analyzed to look for possible correlations between the ratings result of applying the three tests on students. The analysis of the project is implemented through the correlation, which is a statistical process that results in the index of relationship between two or more variables and allows us to see if the process is somehow a characteristic equation is linear or no. Here the correlation is used to relate the categories of learning styles and determine its value, then graphing the result and then get the equation that characterizes the process of Learning Styles relationship. },

However, these traditional CAI and multimedia software which are costly to produce have limitations, they cannot be tailored for individual learning since they lacked the ability to adapt to the student's different learning styles or different academic ability such as relating his incorrect answers to the correct ones. Furthermore, the practice or problems presented in CAI were usually limited to simple drill-and-practice questions after which the student is then given the next module depending on his score in the evaluation of the module. Therefore there is a need for 'intelligence' in these systems so that inferences about student's mastery of topics or tasks and traits such as learning styles can be made in order to dynamically adapt the content or style of instruction. Adaptation of instructional materials to students ability and learning style should facilitate learning. },

As technology gap between enterprises is mainly caused by their knowledge gap, acquiring knowledge, core technological knowledge in particular, is the key to bridging technology gap. And organizational learning is an important means to the end of knowledge acquisition, application and dissemination. Due to the characteristics of knowledge, different stages from imitation to innovation will have different learning focuses, which requires that different organizational learning styles should adapt to the target knowledge as so to ensure effective acquisition, assimilation and application of knowledge.

This has not, however, prevented researchers from exploring whether student performance can be dependent on matching question type to learning style. In a study of medical students, Cook et al. failed to establish such a correlation. However, small sample size and the inherently high inclination of the sample population to succeed were likely high contributing factors. Further, preferences are adaptable by education, and this study was conducted with advanced students. We are interested in the correlations between learning style preferences, task perception, and student performance in the context of an introductory chemical engineering material balances course. Assignments have a natural degree of learning style bias, and we are looking to see if student preferences correlate with their performance and perceptions when these biases are considered. Results will provide evidence regarding whether learning styles can affect student performance, as well as identify naturally occurring biases in chemical engineering problems that are translatable to other fields. A better understanding of student background and learning preferences is invaluable in developing improved curriculum, especially in the ever-changing modern classroom. },

First, The participants (N=41) learning styles were classified using Kolb's Learning Style Inventory (KLSI) which grouped them into either Diverger, Assimilator, Converger or Accommodator style. Subsequently, their brain signal was recorded using EEG and the Frontal Asymmetry was determined using the Asymmetry Relation Ratio (ARR) formula.

Results show that participants in the Converger group performed better than participants with other learning styles.

Interactive simulations (free or textbook-based) are widely used across the undergraduate engineering curriculum to help actively engaged students increase their understanding of abstract concepts or phenomena which are not directly or easily observable. However, there are indications in the literature that we do not yet know the pedagogical best practices associated with their use to maximize learning. This project couples student use of interactive simulations with the gathering of real-time formative assessment via pen-enabled mobile technology (in this case, Tablet PCs). The research question addressed in this paper is: are learning gains achieved with this coupled model greater for certain types of learners in the undergraduate engineering classroom? To answer this, we correlate learning gains with various learning styles, as identified using the Index of Learning Styles (ILS) developed by Felder and Soloman. These insights will be useful for others who use interactive computer simulations in their instruction and other adopters of this pedagogical model; the insights may have broader implications about modification of instruction to address various learning styles. },

There are many learning styles and teachers are usually unable to deliver learning material that matches every possible combination. In this context, several tools, called Adaptive Hypermedia Systems (AHS), have been developed to automatically adapt and recommend learning material according to the students' learning styles. In recent years, educational video games have been used to motivate and engage students, providing a promising form of instruction. However, these video games possess several features. Thus, a particular educational video game could be preferred by a student with a specific learning style, but not by other student with a different style. For this reason, we analyze which students' behaviors described by Felder's learning styles are related to educational video game features. Moreover, we developed an approach to recommend educational video games whose features match the students' learning styles. Experimental results obtained from a population of undergraduate Computer Science students showed several relations between educational video games features and students' behaviors. },

        abstract = { Flipped classroom is an emerging pedagogical model with potentials to support active engagement and improve student performance. This research empirically validate the impact of: 1) Flipped classroom on student performance; and 2) Preferred learning style on student performance in a flipped classroom. We designed an experiment to compare the performance of students in flipped classroom with traditional teaching method. This experiment involves a total of 35 students. The students were divided into two separate classes (01 and 1E) taught by the same professor with the same contents and assessment methods. Students in Class 01 are the `experiment group' and were taught with flipped method, while students in Class 1E are the `control group' and were taught with traditional method. Data was collected from three components of student assessment (Participation, Homework, and Exam) and questionnaire; we used the questionnaire to group students by their preferred learning styles. The key findings after data analysis include a) Students in flipped classroom achieved 7% higher `Participation Grade' than their peers in traditional. b) Students in traditional classroom achieved 17% higher `Homework Grade' and 6% higher `Exam Grade' than their peers in flipped classroom. c) Logical Learners outperformed Visual Learners by 10% in flipped classroom. Further, we discussed the implications of these findings to practice. We expect this paper to be useful and informative to higher education instructors who adopt or plan to adopt flipped classroom in their courses. },

Every e-learning system is designed with a goal to help the student to establish his/her goals and help them when needed. But, the learning style of each student is different, consequently, learning progression and pattern varies among students. A learning style is a characteristic of psychological and cognitive behavior of a user under a learning phase. Hence, a good e-learning system is one which not only recommends concept based on knowledge level but also recommends the type of learning material which will help the student to learn or acquire a skill in the best way. This paper proposes the foundation and operation of an e-learning system which suggests educational concepts and type of learning materials to enrolled students, based on their performance, learning style and learning progression in the system. },

Hence, the need for a high accurate classifier that deals with the students data and generates suitable number of rules that can automatically identify student's learning style in adaptive learning environments is an important issue. In this paper, Bijective soft set algorithm is used in classifying students learning style based on Felder Silverman learning style model. The discernible matrix parameter reduction was used to generate attributes reducts, whereby rules were generated from these reducts. Experiments were carried out using simulated data with various attributes that represent student's characteristics according to the four dimensions of Felder Silverman model. The experiments revealed that Bijective soft set gives high classification accuracy with suitable number of rules. The algorithm was further verified with Rough Set and FURIA as a comparative analysis of the performance of the proposed model. },

Six modules in history and engineering were designed in verbal, visual and multimedia modes. Hundred and four undergraduate students of the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur participated and completed the six modules. The performance in each module was assessed on the basis of recall, recognition, comprehension, and transfer of learning. Based on Inventory of Learning Styles, learners were categorized in visual-verbal and sequential-global dimensions. The verbal, neutral, and visual learners and the sequential, neutral, and global learners did not differ in performance across disciplines. Learners' performance in visual mode for history and in multimedia mode for engineering was found to be superior to other modes. High academic achievers performed better for recognition and comprehension dimensions in history, and recognition dimension in engineering than low academic achievers. Irrespective of learning styles or academic achievements students preferred and found more appropriate visual and multimedia modes over verbal mode of learning. We believe that the null results for learning styles suggest their limited usability for adaptive hypermedia. Similarly, Mayer's multimedia learning cannot be recommended as the most effective mode of learning for all disciplines. We suggest that adaptivity according to disciplines is an important area that needs to be explored. },

In fact, the automatic detection of the pedagogical traits in order to construct a student model that allows inference of the next step in the learning process has been one of the main goals when producing adaptive systems. Learning styles and multiple intelligence theories have been widely used in student modeling to show how a student ad quires knowledge and highlights special learning abilities. Through the bringing together of these two areas of learning a picture of an individual student can be made. This information therefore becomes useful for a tutor to adapt the learning process to the student. It is therefore within this context that this study proposes an innovative method that is driven by the Kolb learning process in order to improve the intelligence percentages by bringing out in each individual those areas in which they excel, but also help in the improvement of the learning process where deficiency is detected. Thus, this method is able to detect and correct automatically the initial self-evaluation.

In this paper, we analyze the behavior of 43 students based on their learning styles and predefined patterns of behavior. Firstly, we concentrated on whether students with different learning style preferences act differently in the course. This information can be used to create courses that include features for each learning style. Secondly, we investigated correlations between the learning style preferences and the behavior of students during the course.

To evaluate the this aproach, the methodology was applied and validated by the Felder and Silverman's dichotomous test vs its diffuse version in an adult population in continuous formation and we found evidence that there are external aspects to those evaluated by the traditional learning styles instruments that could influence the changes of preferences over time. },

With the advent of new technologies such as information technology with e-learning concepts they will get a pretty good learning environment. Different techniques are always being used for learning. That is the temperament of the people. It differs from person to person with respect to the learning purpose, behavior, life style, culture, age, profession and so on. In this the era of e-learning concepts and techniques we should be able to facilitate their learning style and domains. The awareness of learning styles and domain is important in the Sri Lankan context to ease the development of the e-learning content and to enhance the quality of the materials. The focus of this paper however, is on an identification of learning styles and domains within the Sri Lankan community to develop e-learning content to confer the maximum benefit to the end users. Since Sri Lanka is a multi-ethnic country a research has been done considering the above as well. Anyhow one's learning should be oriented towards a common goal what ever the nationality one belongs to. The University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC) was the pioneer center which focused on e-learning content development in Sri Lanka. It has received a massive grant from JICA with their expertise and their knowledge to develop and train the trainers in the field of e-learning content development in Sri Lanka and the Asian region. The Learner must be able to study more content and also adhere to the self learning style because the country needs more self motivated and confident learners for its future development. This paper will describe the key learning styles and domains within the Sri Lankan community to develop e-learning content for all. },

The experimental results have confirmed that LS have a significant influence on (1) the feedback preferences (with regard to response certitude and correctness) of students and (2) the effectiveness of elaborated feedback (EF), i.e. improving studentspsila performance during the test. },

        abstract = { Intelligent tutoring systems are computer learning systems which personalise their learning content for an individual, based on learner characteristics such as existing knowledge. A recent extension to ITS is to capture student learning styles using a questionnaire and adapt subject content accordingly, however students do not always take the time to complete questionnaires carefully. This paper describes Oscar, a conversational intelligent tutoring system (CITS) which utilises a conversational agent to conduct the tutoring. The CITS aims to mimic a human tutor by dynamically estimating and adapting to a student's learning style during a tutoring conversation. Oscar also offers intelligent solution analysis and problem support for learners. By implicitly modelling the student's learning style during tutoring, Oscar can personalise tutoring to each individual learner to improve the effectiveness of the tutoring. The paper presents the novel methodology and architecture for constructing a CITS. An initial pilot study has been conducted in the domain of tutoring of undergraduate Science and Engineering students using the Index of Learning Styles ILS) model. The experiments to investigate the estimation of learning style have produced encouraging results in the estimation of learning style through a tutoring conversation. },

However, such LMS typically do not adapt to students' individual characteristics and provide each student with the same content and presentation. Such one-size-fits-all approach does not fit most students particularly well and can lead to low student performance and satisfaction. In this paper, we present a study to evaluate an advanced adaptive mechanism that extends LMSs with adaptive functionality to automatically provide students with courses that fit their learning styles. The results of this study showed two significant benefits of the adaptive mechanism for students: receiving higher grades on adaptive lessons than on non-adaptive ones while spending a similar amount of time on both, and spending less time on adaptive lessons than on non-adaptive ones while receiving on average the same grades. Based on these results, the proposed adaptive mechanism can be seen as an effective extension to LMSs in order to support students in learning. },

The approach was developed for learning management systems, which are commonly used in e-learning. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, a study with 127 students was performed, comparing the results of the automatic approach with those of a learning style questionnaire. The evaluation yielded good results and demonstrated that the proposed approach is suitable for identifying learning styles. By using the proposed approach, studentspsila learning styles can be identified automatically and be used for supporting students by considering their individual learning styles. },

On the other hand, the quality of screen images on the desktop would be affected by the quality of service (QoS) of the network, since the screen images are transferred to the client from the server by their transfer protocol. In this paper, we discuss the influence of the QoS upon the learning styles caused by the usability over the VDI. By constructing the experimental network using network emulators, we evaluate and discuss the influence of the QoS such as a round trip delay time (DT) and a bandwidth (BW) upon learning style measured by the quality of experience (QoE). As a result, we clarify the relationships between the QoS of the network and the QoE of the e-learning styles. },

This paper overviews the application of learning styles and how those affect the teaching of introductory programming. We performed a systematic mapping study to improve our knowledge about student characteristics in the teaching of programming. Twenty-one papers were relevant for our research. The main findings are: i) the Soloman-Felder Index is the most used model of learning style; ii) studies focus on the effects of learning styles on student performance; iii) instructors apply active approaches to motivate a different kind of learners. We conclude that learning style does affect a student's ability to learn.

Little research has been dedicated specifically to pedagogical approaches for teaching data mining, and educational programs have remained primarily within Computer Science departments, often targeting graduate students. This paper presents the findings of an examination into the teaching of data mining concepts to undergraduates. The research was conducted by delivering an Association Rules lesson to 86 student participants. The participants received the lesson through either a Direct Instruction or a Concept Attainment teaching approach. <i>T-tests</i> and <i>ANOVA</i> determined if significant differences existed between the scores generated under the two teaching models and within Kolb's four learning styles. The findings show that effectively teaching data mining concepts to the target audience is not as simple as choosing one teaching methodology over another or targeting a specific learning style group. The results also indicate that data mining concepts and techniques can be effectively taught to the target audience. },

Since learners have different needs, abilities and learning preferences, we should fit the curriculum and teaching strategies to these different learning styles. This article investigates the impact of using LAES (Libyan Adaptive Education System) on the performance of learners. An ALSI (Arabic Learning Style Instrument) was integrated into the LAES system to consider learner preferences. Results obtained by the learners in the ALSI instrument were used to initialize their profiles. And then, an experimental study was conducted to investigate the impact of LAES system on the performance of learners. The results reveal the students who have learnt using LAES system were better than others who have learnt without the LAES in terms of the knowledge gained. },

The current model of open learning has certain limitations which provide potential for improvement. One such area is personalization in learning environments. One avenue to enhance learning experience in open learning environments is giving consideration to learning principles and cognitive science. This paper aims to introduce a proposal for an adaptive model to personalize the open learning environments based on the theory of learning styles and particularly the Felder and Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM). This model consists of two main agents to perform its functionalities. First, the identification agent which is responsible of identifying the learners' learning styles by monitoring certain determined patterns of learners' behaviors with learning objects while the learner interact with learning materials. Second, the recommender agent which is responsible of providing an adaptable navigational support based on the identified learning styles and preferences. The paper presents a description of the model and its functionalities including the patterns that can be monitored in open learning environments to identify the learning styles and also how the adaptation support can be provided based on the identified styles. Future implementation will test and verify this proposed model. },

In this context, we have found that some features related to the student personality, intelligence and learning styles (such as neuroticism, spatial abilities, openness to experience, or sensing learning style) seem to influence their performance. This information can be useful in scenarios of face-to-face learning, blended learning or e-learning. In the context of e-learning, we find this information particularly useful for two purposes. Firstly, it allows the detection of potential students or groups with risk to fail when trying to achieve academic objectives and, therefore, makes it possible to prevent them from failing, by offering them personalized assistance in advance. Secondly, specific grouping criteria can be set for dynamic group formation, trying to lead the students to successful collaborative experiences. },

MoocRec is a unique learning styles-oriented system that recommends the most suitable courses to a learner from different MOOC platforms based on their learning styles and individual needs. The courses are recommended based on the mapping of Felder and Silverman learning styles with the standard video styles used in MOOC videos (including talking head, slide, tutorial/demonstration).

The framework of the active experiences in a materials engineering course was changed from music strings and stringed instrument design to biomedical devices which experience significant loads in service because selected student outcomes were still below expectations. Simultaneously, the research project was changed from an individual activity to a cooperative learning experience. More in-class active experiences were also completed cooperatively. The net result was an improvement in thirteen student outcomes and in written and oral language usage. The effect of student learning styles on outcomes was not apparent, but they may be important in forming effective cooperative teams. Overall, stringed musical instruments were not as robust in building student outcomes when compared to the biomedical device approach. },

This results in teacher understanding about each student’s learning preferences and behavior, which exhibits, for instance, students’ learning styles and affective states. On the other hand, identification of learning styles and affective states in web-based learning environments is quite challenging. The existing approaches for the identification of learning styles such as questionnaire is not without limitations. Similarly, affective states identification approaches mentioned in the literature indicate several shortcomings. This paper proposes an automatic approach for the identification of learning styles and affective states in web-based Learning Management Systems (LMSs). The unique feature of this approach is that it is generic in nature. Using this approach, the students learning styles and affective states are calculated automatically from their learning preferences and behavior within a course. Evaluation of this approach was performed by following a study with 81 students. The results of the study were then compared with the learning styles and affective states questionnaires, which demonstrate that the suggested approach is more appropriate for the identification of learning styles and affective states. Therefore, using this approach, a tool (AsLim) has been developed and can be used by the teachers for the identification of learning styles and affective states of their students. },

An extended approach and architecture for identifying learning styles which consider cognitive traits is also introduced. Furthermore, an experiment has been conducted that shows the positive effect of considering WMC in the detection process of learning styles for two out of three learning style dimensions, leading to higher precision of the results and therefore more accurate identification of learning styles which in turn lead to more accurate adaptivity for students. },

Due to more sophisticated information systems and advanced educational requirements speech also recognizes growing importance in human-computer interaction. The present study investigates a text-to-speech (TTS) feature in a learning context. 252 questionnaires allow for descriptions concerning positive and negative experiences of TTS learners. Additionally, descriptive insights for enjoyment factors are provided and differences between German and English texts are shown. Furthermore, preferences of different learning styles and values of TTS features conveyed are explored. Findings provide a starting point for more specific future studies through insights into TTS evaluation in a learning context. Based on positive and negative experiences 13 dimensions relevant for a performance measurement scale are suggested. It is shown that among others, theoretical texts and exercises are appreciated as TTS especially by the aural learning style to enable for instance language learning on the go. },

In conjunction, the number of students with learning disabilities and learning difficulties has risen to twenty percent in a leading college. In earlier research, the match between students' learning styles (LS) and their teachers' instructional strategies (IS) and the correlation of this LS-IS match with students' academic achievements was studied. Nevertheless, there is no report of research where one-on-one education is implemented. Moreover, there are no references about the match of a trainees' LS to their tutors' IS and the correlation of this LS-IS match with the trainees' achievements as presented in the current paper. To measure the LS- IS match, two different methods were used. First, calculating the correlation between trainees' LS and tutors' IS (LS-IS correlation); second, calculating the LS-IS distance. Thirty-nine tutors were paired with 42 trainees with learning disabilities (three tutors had two trainees each) during the 2016 academic year. Thus, 42 pairs of tutors and trainees worked to help the trainees achieve better academic grades. The Felder-Soloman Index of Learning Styles (ILS) was used to measure the tutors' preferred IS and the trainees' preferred LS. In both methods, the LS-IS match was correlated with the trainees' grades. If the LS-IS match influences the trainees' achievements, significant positive correlations in the first method and significant negative correlation in the second method must appear. Nevertheless, the results show no significant correlation (positive or negative, accordingly) between the LS-IS match and students' achievements at the end of the first semester of 2016 and again at the end of the second semester of 2016. },

However, most of these systems tailor presentation content and navigational support solely according to students' prior knowledge. On the other hand, previous research suggested that learning styles significantly affect student learning because they refer to how learners process and organize information. To this end, this paper presents an approach to integrate learning styles into adaptive e-learning hypermedia. The main objectives were to develop a Learning Style based Adaptive E-learning Hypermedia System (LS-AEHS) and assess the effect of adapting educational materials individualized to the student's learning style. In this work, our main goal aims to adopting the theory of experiential learning in the context of the DAVID KOLB's model to pass of this learning style model to define the adaptation rules in order to adapt the learning content and the navigation to each learning style in KOLB model. To achieve the main objectives, a case study was developed. An experimental evaluation was designed to evaluate the new approach of matching learning materials with learning styles and their influence on student's learning achievement. The findings support the use of learning styles as guideline for adaptation into the adaptive e-learning hypermedia systems. },

This paper explores the relationships between actual students' use of the Web 2.0 tools and their learning styles classified according to Felder-Silverman model. The context of the study is an undergraduate course on Web Applications' Design, with 45 enrolled students. Several machine learning algorithms for classification, association rule induction and feature selection are applied.

The aim of the submitted article is to diagnose the preferred learning styles of generation group Z from the selected secondary technical school and to find the relationship between diagnosed learning styles and the learning results from the general educational subjects. The achievement of the aim was conditioned by the selecting of diagnostic collection tools, setting of the research questions and the research hypotheses, the establishment of the research methods, the definition of the research sample, processing and statistical evaluation of obtained data, interpretation and finally, the summary of the results. The analysed data have been obtained by using the standardized (valid, reliabile) questionnaires. Particularly have been used VARK and LSI IIa) questionnaire. VARK means visual, arual, write/read and kinesthetic questionnaire. LSI IIa) means learning style inventory in revised version. The research methods used in processing of the paper consist of analysis, synthesis, deduction, induction and comparison. Obtained data were analyzed by using the descriptive statistic (histogram, frequency, pie diagrams and table evaluation) and inferential statistics (test of normality, Spearman's test, correlation test). The data have been processed in the statistical program SPSS from IBM and in MS EXCEL from Microsoft. The most important results of the paper are verified by the statistical important relationship between selected general educational subjects and selected learning styles (rs = 0.456, r = 0.346, r = 0.614 and r = 0.184). The research findings show, that the students of the generation group Z generally achieve average results from general educational subjects and have growing problem with decreasing the learning results.

Learning styles are a criteria of great import in E-learning environment because they can help the system to effectively personalize students' learning process. Generally, the traditional way of detecting students' learning style is based on asking students to fill out a questionnaire. However, using this static technique presents many problems. Some of these problems include the lack of self-awareness of students of their learning preferences. In addition, almost all students are bored when they are asked to fill out a questionnaire. Thus, in this work, we present an automatic approach for detecting students' learning style based on web usage mining. It consists in classifying students' log files according to a specific learning style model (Felder and Silverman model) using clustering algorithms (K-means algorithm). In order to test the efficiency of our work, we use a real-world dataset gathered from an E-learning system. Experimental results show that our approach provide promising results. },

The learner's profile represents the learner's general information such as identification data, the learner's knowledge implies the learner's interests on visited learning objects, and the learner's educational preferences are composed of the learner's preferences among visited learning objects and his/her learning style. In the proposed approach, all learner model components are automatically detected, without requiring explicit feedback. Indeed, all the basic learners' information is inferred from the learners' online activities and usage data, based on web usage mining techniques and a literature-based approach for the automatic detection of learning styles in learning management systems. Once learner models are built, we apply a hierarchical multi-level model based collaborative filtering approach, in order to gather learners with similar preferences and interests in the same groups. },

However, there is little research evidence on the adoption and adaptation of learning styles in an e-learning environment, specifically in respect of personalised learning environments. In this context, evidence identifies that the more thoroughly instructors understand the differences in learning styles, the better chance they have of meeting the diverse learning needs of learners. In this respect, providing learners with learning environments that suit their learning style can have positive impact on learning effectiveness. Many learning styles inventories/instruments have attempted to augment learners' learning styles with learning methods, albeit without taking on board the criticism levied at inventories and similar instruments in terms of reliability and validity(including the rubrics behind the models of learning styles). This paper identifies the process of amalgamating three existing models of learning styles (Kolb; Honey and Mumford; and Felder and Solomon), into a `diagnostic questionnaire' learning style inventory for reflection and discussion. },

        abstract = { Inspections aid software managers by early detection and removal of faults committed during the creation of requirements and design documents. This helps reduce the rework during the later stages of software development. While inspections are effective in practice, the evidence suggests that the effectiveness of inspectors varies widely. Cognitive psychologists have used Learning Style (LS) to show the improvement in student's score by considering their characteristic strength and preferences to acquire and process information. This concept of LS can cross over to software engineering as a means of increasing the inspection effectiveness. This paper investigates the effect of the LS of inspectors on fault detection abilities of inspection teams and individual inspectors. Using the inspection data with varying number of participants, we analyzed the effect of the LS of inspectors across various inspection team sizes on the inspection performance. We also analyzed the effect of LS categories on the individual inspection performance. The initial results show that the teams composed of inspectors with different LS preferences are more effective and efficient than the teams of inspectors who had similar LS's. The results also provide insights into the LS categories that favor requirements inspection. },

        abstract = { One of the commonly adopted parameters in personalized e-learning is learning style. As an individual trait, this parameter indicates the preferable learning object for a specific type of a learner. When considering collaborative learning environment through online chat and discussion, the learners can express their opinion on a shared learning object. Besides, level of interaction with the object is also important to identify the learning style. The nature of generated contents during discussion makes it difficult to extract the required information. In this paper we discuss how to identify the learning style from the learning object preferences expressed by the learner via the online discussion in a collaborative learning platform. To do so, the paper proposes an ontology-based Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model to represent the relationship between the learning style and preferable learning object. The model also obtains the learner's opinion more than one time by using time slice to make the indication of learning styles more accurate. Consequently, providing the learner the appropriate personalized learning package. },

The data reveal that there are significant differences of preferences for the learning styles of Mathematics students among the 8 faculties with respect to scales of Detail, Authority, Numeric, Qualitative, Inanimate, People, Reading, and Direct Experience. Male students show strong preferences for scales of Instructor, Inanimate, and Direct Experience whereas female students show strong preferences for scales of Detail, Independent, Qualitative, and People. The scales of Organization, Numeric, A and B Expectations of the course grade are learning styles which contribute to a positive relationship to academic achievements while scales of Goal, Qualitative, People and D Expectation of the course grade are learning styles that have a negative relationship to academic achievements.

Since the data collected from students based on their learning styles is categorical, outlier detection analysis for categorical data is used to eliminate outliers from this data. These outliers are occurred while collecting data from students. Because some students are very peculiar, some students are not interested to reveal their data, some students may give wrong answers for any questionnaire by bias and some students may give incomplete data due to lack of time. The data is collected from B.Tech students from different colleges for experiments. After eliminating outliers from this data by proposed outliers' techniques, different classifiers are applied to frame set of rules to select suitable courses based on their learning styles.

Students learn in various ways, such as by observing, listening, acting, reasoning, memorizing, and visualizing. Students also think in different ways, and critical thinking is a desirable competency in academic achievement. Critical thinking may be influenced by individual learning preferences. The learning styles and critical thinking skills of engineering students are factors that contribute to how they learn to achieve the learning outcome and to their readiness to enter the market. Existing technology and workplace trends require engineers who are equipped with critical thinking skills, such as solving problems, making decisions, and understanding of technical and engineering concepts for a successful future. Therefore, this paper discusses the analyses of the learning styles and critical thinking skills of 315 engineering students from Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia. The Index of Learning Styles was adopted to measure the learning styles of the students, whereas a questionnaire for critical thinking was used to determine the critical thinking skills of the students in four dimensions: analysis, evaluation, induction, and deduction. Result shows that the engineering students are more inclined to be visual than verbal learners and they have received moderate critical thinking scores in each dimension. The result also indicates that no relationship exists between the learning styles and critical thinking skills of the engineering students. },

We found that students in the course preferred active, sensing, visual and sequential learning styles. There was no significant difference in the course completion rates along any dimension that could not be explained based on prior preparation. Reflective and intuitive learners earned better grades in the course than active and sensing learners. While male students earned better grades than female students and traditionally represented students earned better grades than underrepresented students, these differences may be attributable to differences in prior preparation. In this context, SAT scores were found to be better predictors of student grades in Computer Science I than high school GPA. Programming projects in the course favored reflective students whereas online assignments favored sensing and sequential learners - unsurprising, since the design of these course instruments were congruent with the definition of these learning styles. It is hoped that this study provides insight into the types of course activities that might be incorporated into Computer Science I to accommodate the different learning styles of students. },

In this study, the synergy between learning styles, learning patterns, and gender as a selected demographic feature and learners' performance were quantitatively investigated in a blended learning setting. This environment adopts a traditional teaching approach of `one-size-fits-all' without considering individual user's preferences and attitudes. Hence, evidence can be provided about the value of taking such factors into account in Adaptive Educational Hypermedia Systems (AEHSs). Felder and Soloman's Index of Learning Styles (ILS) was used to identify the learning styles of 59 undergraduate students at the University of Babylon. Five hypotheses were investigated in the experiment. Our findings show that there is no statistical significance in some of the assessed factors. However, processing dimension, the total number of hits on course website and gender indicated a statistical significance on learners' performance. This finding needs more investigation in order to identify the effective factors on students' achievement to be considered in Adaptive Educational Hypermedia Systems (AEHSs). },

The goal of this study was to determine the relationship between students' learning styles, as determined by the Felder-Solomon Inventory of Learning Styles (ILS), and their cognitive abilities. This study uses functional electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate the areas of neural activation in the brain while engineering students are performing a mental rotation task. Learning style preferences and mental rotation scores are correlated with the EEG activation. Learning styles differences were observed, primarily across gender. Most of these differences were in EEG patterns as opposed to actual task performance, indicating that individuals of different gender and learning style preference might be engaging different parts of the brain on a task while exhibiting similar performance on the task. },

This paper investigates the performance of similar learning style groups and diverse learning style groups in group work, and explores how a grouping algorithm based on students' learning styles affects students' learning achievements and processes. An empirical study with current undergraduate students in the UK has been conducted. The participating students were invited to accomplish two group discussion tasks. Each student performed the two activities, in a separate group each time, once in a group consisting of students with similar learning styles, once in a group with diverse learning styles. No volunteer shared both groups with any individual student. This paper focuses on analysing the learning achievements and collaboration processes for the two types of groups, particularly with respect to the quality of group interactions. A significant difference was found between the percentages of time spent on meaningful interactions by the two types of groups, revealing that diverse learning style groups tend to spend significantly more time on meaningful interactions than similar learning style groups. In addition, the diverse learning style groups had demonstrated significantly less negative social-emotional reactions in showing disagreements. },

Throughout an automated conversational tutorial with a CITS, aspects of student behaviour are dynamically captured and input to a Learning Styles Predictor agent to profile an individual's learning style. The proposed method will incorporate a MLP-ANN to combine a set of behaviour traits extracted from the tutoring conversation to improve the accuracy of the learning styles prediction. The paper describes experiments conducted with real students in a live teaching/learning environment for profiling two Felder and Silverman learning styles dimensions. The results show that MLP-ANNs can predict learning styles with an accuracy of 84-89%. },

Here we present the results of these assessments and explore comparisons between the three assessment tools.

Also, when under conflict, such as may arise on a team project, studentspsila behavior changes and is influenced by their MBTI type.

The personal characteristics of their students are radically different from the traditional academic offer. Students learn by practicing and they comprehend information best by actively doing something with the information. We ran an experiment with students of a technical degree of web development in a course of Programming Introduction using Python. Preliminary findings revealed that their learning styles are mainly active and visual, and learners who are more verbal or have stronger concrete experience obtained higher scores in their tests. They perceive that inductive tasks are easier than deductive and abductive tasks. We also found that those subjects who are more efficient in solving formal inference tasks obtained higher qualifications in their exams. The findings can be useful not only for didactic transposition in teaching courses which take into account the balance of the students' preference but also to develop new instructional methods and software which focus on the cognitive preferences and cognitive process of technicians. },

        abstract = { The reader who approaches this topic for the first time may be confused by the usage of the terms?>cognitive style?> and?>learning style.?> Snow, Corno, and Jackson (1996), under the heading?>personal styles?>, write that?>no category we have covered contains a more voluminous, complex and controversy-laced literature than that of personal styles.. They classified the kinds of constructs that have been studied under six headings. These are:?>Cognitive styles?> involved in perception and thinking (e.g. field independence versus dependence, reflection versus impulsivity.?>Learning styles?> involved in approaches to learning and studying (e.g,. deep versus surface processing, comprehension learning versus operation learning).?>Expressive styles,?> involved in verbal or nonverbal communication (e.g. tempo, constricted versus expansive).?>Response styles?> involved in self-perception and self-report (e.g., acquiescence, deception).?>Defensive styles?> involved in accommodating anxiety and conflict (e.g. obsessive-compulsive, hysterical),?>Cognitive controls?> a subset of style like but function-specific and unipolar controls on attention and behavior (e.g. constricted versus flexible control)?> (p. 281).Riding and Rayner (1998) argued that learning styles are a subset of cognitive styles, and in this they agreed with Sternberg and Grigorenko (1997), who also reviewed the literature on this concept. Sternberg and Grigorenko classified styles as cognition centered, personality centered, or activity centered. Those that are cognition centered have a relationship with ability and measures of intelligence, The MBTI personality measure that has been much used among engineering students is as its focus implies personality centered. The other instrument that has appealed to engineers, The Learning Styles Inventory (Kolb) is activity-centered.It is a consolation to this writer that Snow, Corno and Jackson (1996) decided not to make any sharp distinction between learning styles and cognitive styles, or between styles and approaches. Nevertheless, I have made some distinctions and begin with a discussion of learning strategies.Learning strategies are devices that we use to cope with the learning environments we find ourselves in. Learning styles are dispositions we have to learning. They are preferred ways of organizing what we see and think. The Chapter begins with a discussion of strategies, and in particular deep and surface approaches to learning. It has been shown that learning environments and, in particular, the assessments used can have a harmful or less than positive effect on learning, as, for example, if they cause surface learning. For this reason the effects of an outcomes-based approach to assessment needs to be evaluated in terms of its effects on learning. From the perspective of engineering it has been shown that engineers require a variety of learning styles when they are engaged in projects. They need, for example, to be both convergent and divergent thinkers. The case for this view is presented. A brief discussion of field-independent and field-dependent styles of thinking follows. Although spatial ability is not strictly speaking a style, it is important in engineering design. Engineers need to be able to visualize, and consequently they need a highly developed spatial ability.Therefore, since we have predispositions to learn, the style that we have may be in conflict with the style of teaching to which we are exposed, a major question is whether teaching and learning styles should be matched. Given that engineers need a variety of styles, it is incumbent on teachers to foster their development, and that suggests teachers may have to change their teaching styles. Engineers have used a number of instruments to determine the learning styles of their students. These include Kolb's Learning Styles Inventory and a summary of work that has been done to use it as a scheme for the design of instruction is given. Variations of the Kolb model are summarized in particular the 4 MAT scheme and Honey and Mumford model.Felder and Silverman identified 32 learning styles and developed an inventory to test for these among engineering students. This is discussed. Style and personality are related and influence the way we learn in particular environments. Engineers have been particularly interested in the Myers Briggs Personality Indicator, and much is known about the personality profiles of engineering students from this test. The investigations among engineering students are summarized. Temperament evidently influences performance but to some extent as a function of the culture of the learning environment.Other sections of the Chapter discuss cognitive styles analysis, the relationship between course structure and learning styles and learning strategies, learning styles and individualised environments. The review supports a point made by Hein and Budny (1999) that the learning style assessment tool used is not as critical as the assessment of learning styles. It illustrates the complexity of the learning process that teachers have to face when they guide the learning of a diverse group of students. Overall the reported research supports the need for variety in teaching and learning not only for the sake of learning but for preparation for work in industry. It also supports the case for multiple strategy approaches to the assessment of student learning. },

In this paper, to provide an effective in-classroom learning environment for most students, we propose to develop appropriate instructional presentation methods to match diversity of learning styles. We demonstrate how to align in-class instructions, such as quizzes and other in-class learning activities, with students' learning styles. Our discussion, which primarily focuses on quantitative topics, relies on research in education and applied psychology, and our teaching experience. Here, we utilize the Fleming's VARK learning style model. We then address some shortcomings of identifying students' learning styles through a generic questionnaire, and propose a scheme to dynamically infer them. This automatic student modeling approach can be easily adopted in distance education. },

One significant research direction in this domain is finding effective methods for personalized course composition from a library of learning objects with respect to each learner's characteristics, goals and preferences. In this paper we employ decision support models for providing course compositions tailored to the specific characteristics of each individual learner, with an emphasis on the learning style of the learner. We show how these models can formally accommodate various features and preferences of the learner as well as how they can assist the learner in evaluating each solution by different criteria. We also propose methods for incorporating social behavior of the learners to the model in order to make use of other learners' experiences and provide higher levels of personalization for the target learner. },

This information may range from data and facts to creative ideas. Recent work by R. Felder and L. Silverman (1988) has shown that individuals differ from one another in how they prefer to receive and process information. In this paper, we look at the relationship between individuals' preference for receiving information and their methods of sending information. It was initially anticipated that each individual's mode of presenting information would match his or her preferred mode of receiving information, and that this match would result in improved communication. To study the congruency (or incongruency) of how individuals prefer to receive information and how they go about sending information, an experiment was designed and conducted. The experiment consisted of four teams of engineering educators engaged in a design exercise. Their design activities were videotaped. Results based on analysis of the tapes and individual learning styles inventories showed that most participants preferred to receive information visually and engaged in drawing very little during the design exercise. If the definition was expanded to include using drawings, communicative gesturing (i.e. using hand gestures to describe a physical object or action), using hardware and referencing hardware, then visual communication went from comprising an average of 3.8% of the design time to an average of 21.1% of the design time. },

This was conducted in the course “Physics of materials”, in which we analyzed the contribution of practical experience in the learning process. The study aims to assess the degree of interest, motivation and understanding by students on academic content, which is often abstract, and of which practical demonstrations with resources prepared by 3D printing can become a learning facilitator. To this end, the learning styles of students were determined through the Honey-Alonso Learning Styles Questionnaire (CHAEA). This questionnaire allows teachers and students to know the learning styles and how each student interacts and relates in group activities. It includes a section on practical experience, motivation and the acquisition of knowledge of the students, who were unanimous in ranking high the importance of 3D printing technology in teaching activities in the classroom. As a collaborative learning resource, it is concluded that 3D printing can positively help teachers establish an improved teaching environment for students by including different methodological styles in the learning process. This is particularly effective in courses with a significant theoretical content. The increasing availability of 3D printing combined with the motivational aspect of its usage as a learning facilitator establish a revolutionary and powerful resource for active learning. },

The first interpretation sees personality and life experience as the key influences on learning styles, while the second defines learning styles as the practices students develop in response to the expectations of their teachers. The literature relating to each interpretation is considered, with particular reference to certain social and cultural groups which are under-represented in electronic engineering in the authors' university.

Studies in Cognitive Psychology and Pedagogy have already reported that each individual has a specific Learning Style, which describes her/his best means of perceiving and acquiring knowledge. The detection of the personal Learning Style of each student has long been made by using questionnaires; an analysis that demands too much effort, mainly in courses with hundreds of students. Therefore, the automatic modeling of learning styles has gained attention in the computing and education areas. This study compares different Machine Learning algorithms for the detection of students' Learning Styles. As such, a dataset is extracted from a real course in the Moodle learning platform. This course had 105 students interacting with 252 learning objects during 12 months. The learning styles were described using the classic model of Felder-Silverman. According to the experimental results using these data, a single machine learning algorithm was not able to induce models with predictive accuracy comparable to those from existing alternatives. However, when models from different algorithms were combined, it was possible to obtain a predictive accuracy superior to those reported in the related literature. },

This work is motivated by the changing nature of both education and learners and the need to provided personalized tutoring on demand.

Two key findings were identified by combining many methods including boxplots and ANOVA. First, there was no effect on the complexity level of the visual/verbal learners behaviour. Second, subject's diversity has an effect on visual learner behaviour. Also, the paper describes the implemented experiment approach in our smart lab.

        abstract = { The e-learning recommender system in learning institutions is increasingly becoming the preferred mode of delivery, as it enables learning anytime, anywhere. However, delivering personalised course learning objects based on student’s preferences is still a challenge. Current mainstream recommendation algorithms, such as the Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Content-Based Filtering (CBF), deal with only two types of entities, namely users and items with their ratings. However, these methods do not pay attention to student’s preferences, such as learning styles, which are especially important for the accuracy of course learning objects prediction or recommendation. Moreover, several recommendation techniques experience cold-start and rating sparsity problems. To address the challenge of improving the quality of recommender systems, in this paper a novel recommender algorithm for machine learning is proposed, which combines students actual rating with their learning styles to recommend personalised course learning objects (LOs). Various recommendation techniques are considered in an experimental study investigating the best technique to use in predicting student ratings for e-learning recommender systems. We use the Felder-Silverman Learning Styles Model (FSLSM) to represent both the student learning styles and the learning object profiles. The predicted ratings are compared with the actual student ratings to determine the accuracy of the recommendation techniques, using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metrics. This approach has been experimented on 80 students for an online course created in the MOODLE Learning Management System. The results of the experiment show that the best recommendation technique is our proposed hybrid recommendation algorithm that combines the collaborative filtering and the content-based filtering techniques to enhance the accuracy of the predictions, and solves the cold-start and the rating sparsity problems using the FSLSM representations of the student learning styles and the learning object profiles. },

The main technologies used to create the system are Semantic Web, ontologies, recommender system, and intelligent software agents. First of all, the authors performed systematic review on intelligent software agents' application in education. After that, they have analysed students' preferences to certain learning styles according to Felder and Silverman Learning Styles Model which is widely recognised the most suitable for engineering disciplines. This analysis is necessary to further creating personalised learning units / scenarios optimised for particular learners in conformity with their learning styles and other preferences. These learning units should consist of suitable learning components (learning objects, learning activities, and learning environments) optimal for particular students. Scientific methodology to creating optimised learning units for particular learners is based on expert evaluation method and application of intelligent technologies - ontologies, recommender systems, and intelligent software agents. The novel model of personalised intelligent learning system for engineering students based on application of intelligent software agents is presented in more detail. The main success factors of this approach are application of pedagogically sound vocabularies of the learning components used to create personalised learning units, and the experts' collective intelligence. },

The main reason behind the implementation of this application, is to offer the possibility to index the didactic resources, available in the adaptive learning system, with so much information about the learning objects, that usually are not available in the common learning objects' softwares, mainly the learning styles and teaching styles, since the adaptive learning system which we take as a basis, relies a lot on this kind of information, to correct the generated learning paths in case it turned out to be not the leading ones. },

        abstract = { Modern technologies have been greatly employed to support teachers and learners for facilitating teaching and learning processes. Recommender systems (RSs) for technology-enhanced learning (TEL) are among those new technologies that have been researched extensively within the past few years. This is because RSs for TEL are intelligent decision support systems that assist internet users in finding suitable learning objects that might match their preferences on the kinds of materials they could require to enhanced their learning activities. However, most of the existing RSs for learning used traditional techniques (2-dimensional user × item, techniques) to recommend learning objects to users without considering the contexts in which the recommendation should be made. Those contexts could be the geographical locations, the level of education, the time of the day or week, their learning preferences, and so on. This paper proposed a conceptual framework of smart media-based context-aware RSs for learning that could consider the learning preferences of users as a context for making accurate and usable recommendations. The proposed system was designed to run on smart devices for learners to test and know their learning styles and receive learning object recommendations according to their learning preferences. The paper contains the conceptualization of the framework and the details of the design and implementation procedure. },

In e-learning contexts, it is not only students' educational experiences which are being designed, but also their interaction with technology. Students have dual identities, as both learners and users. The paper reviews principles of usability in the discipline of human-computer interaction and its recommendations for facilitating ease-of-use in systems. It compares this with educational literature on learning styles which suggests that 'deep' learning is not necessarily easy. The paper discusses the difficulties which arise in the context of e-learning, when the processes and practices of educational and technological design are conflated. That is, what happens when the user and learner are one and the same, when systems are designed for learning, not just for use? Reviewing and juxtaposing literature from the disciplines of technology and educational design, the paper highlights differences in pedagogy and practice. In turn, it examines how these are manifest in IT students' perceptions of the role of technology in their own education },

Student model will be built on data gathered during continuous evaluation together with students' learning styles and foreknowledge about digital tools. Activity model represents items that will be recommended: learning materials, tasks for learning using digital tools, and colleagues that can help in mastering particular subject content together with materials needed for knowledge assessment. The recommender will include original pedagogical rules for generating recommendations.

This framework is designed considering multimodal interaction mechanisms by means of using different communicative channels (visual, auditory and speech). Additionally, its architecture is formed mainly by: 1) a student model including individual reading profiles, learning styles and cognitive traits, 2) an adaptation engine based on the delivery of learning analytics and adapted recommendations, and 3) tracking tools to measure the performance and satisfaction of users.

Several researchers focus on the theory of teamwork organizations, based on academic performances, learning styles, learning settings, gender, etc. Therefore, grouping learners based on their predicted academic performance level in each subject separately may be more effective in a collaborative learning environment, but it still a challenging subject. First of all, we present in this paper a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the relevant studies that address the problem of predicting academic performance and to extract the used data mining methods such as Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, etc. At the beginning, a set of 658 papers were selected. After applying the different SLR's steps, this selection has been filtered to 12 papers using specific selection criteria and a careful analysis of each paper. Then, the selected studies were used to answer the defined research questions. Finally, synthesis data, current research gaps and recommendations for further work are discussed in this paper. },
